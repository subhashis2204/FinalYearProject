## Getting started 

The following environment variable are necessary for configuring the project in your local - 

### **1. Azure** 

- Step 1: Create an Azure account
> You must have an azure storage account for the project.
> <br>
> Images are stored as a **blob** in azure. So we need to have a blob container which we would access through our **access keys**
> <br>
> If you are a student then you can sign up for a $100 free credit on azure [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/students/)
> <br><br>
> ![azure_sa_img](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/1bd490ac-cf36-42df-ae52-091ff8e6bcc3)

- Step 2: Creating a new resource
> After selecting the storage account. We need to create a new resource.
> <br><br>
> ![azure_sa_create](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/8b68b18f-b0eb-4fc4-8aed-60e092920ae9)

- Step 3: Fill the form
> A form is displayed. You only need to fill in the type of subscription and the name of storage account. 
> <br>
> Leave rest to default. Then go to the resource and search for access keys.
> <br><br>
> ![azure_sa_aks](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/1acef25e-a733-4c3c-806d-67a7451bda58)

- Step 4: Choose connnection string
> After clicking the *access keys*, we can see our **storage account name** and **connection string** (there are two of them, choose anyone)

- Step 5: Setting up container
> As a last step in the resource page, you have to set up the container where we would store the images.
> <br>
> In your newly created storage acc dashboard, click on the blob storag
> <br>
> You must see a page where you can create a new container. **Remember this name as we need it**
> <br>
> Environment variables to configure azure storage:
> ```sh
> CONTAINER_NAME = <BLOB STORAGE CONTAINER NAME>
> CONNECTION_STRING = <CONNECTION STRING FOR STORAGE ACCOUNT>
> ```
  
<br>

### **2. Sendgrid email notification**

Sendgrid is a bulk emailing service. This project uses Sendgrid along with nodemailer to send transactional emails.
  
Follow these steps to enable sendgrid email notification - 
- Step 1: To get started you must have a sendgrid account. You can create one [here](https://sendgrid.com/). You can opt for the free tier. It does not require any credit card.
- Step 2: After signup you need to create an API key. **copy the api key and save it somewhere since you won't be able to see it again**.
- Step 3: Since, we have reached this far. One final step is that we have to setup an email which would be authorized to send emails using sendgrid.

  <pre>
  Go to the dashboard and on the left pane go to <b>_settings_</b> ‚Üí <b>_sender authentication_</b> ‚Üí <b>_single sender verification_</b> ‚Üí click on <b>_create new sender_</b> <br>
  Fill in the necessary details and then you can start sending email using sendgrid. <br>

  </pre>
</details>

> Environment variables to configure azure storage:
> ```sh
> CONTACTS_EMAIL_NAME = <CONTACT RECEIPIENT NAME>
> CONTACTS_EMAIL = <CONTACT US PAGE EMAIL>
> SENDER_MAIL = <SENDGRID VERIFIED EMAIL>
> SENDGRID_API_KEY = <YOUR API KEY>
> ```
  
<br>

### **3. MongoDB**

> For running our application we need a DB. This project uses mongodb as the database. You can create a free account on the mongodb website and create a db in the cloud.

- Step 1: First you have to create a **project**, then after creating a project you can create a DB.

- Step 2: Go to the dashboard and on the **left pane** search **deployments**, then click **Build a database**
> ![db_deploy](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/9f4386b6-4f03-4dfd-8721-d728e00f7252)

- Step 3: You would be redirected to a page where you have to choose the config of database. Choose **free tier** and choose a cloud provider and **any region of your choice** and **choose a cluster name**>

- Step 4: You would be provided a **username** and **password**. Note them down somewhere.

- Step 5: Scroll down to the IP access list. Add **0.0.0.0** as the ip. This would enable global access to your db. Click on **close**
> ![ip_access](https://github.com/subhashis2204/project-annapurna/assets/76895635/86e4a223-170f-4d32-ab7b-6551104a9a30)
> A typical mongodb url string looks like this : 
> ```sh
> _mongodb+srv://\<username\>:\<password\>@cluster345.hy4gkmn.mongodb.net/_
> ```
> The **username** is already given. You need to replace the **password** in the connection string. This gives the full connection string.
> ```sh
> MONGODB_URL = <DB CONNECTION STRING>
> ```
  
<br>

### **4. Google Maps API (OPTIONAL)**

> To show the google maps in the profile pages of restaurants and NGO we need to sign up for a google map API. This project specifically uses **GOOGLE maps Javascript API**.<br>
> ```sh
> GOOGLEMAP_TOKEN = <YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>
> ```
